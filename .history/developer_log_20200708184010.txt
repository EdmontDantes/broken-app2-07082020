Debugging Work step-by-step log:

1. make .env file with PORT, MONGODB_URI, SESSION_SECRET
2. copy from local copies /public/images dir to this repo
3. npm install
4. start the server with npm run dev
5. errored out because it seems that bcryptjs wasn't installed in package.json, doing it now and testing again - Works
6. errored out due to async wasn't install in package.json, doing it now and testing again - works
7. errored out, MongoStore is not defined in app.js, fixed
8. route / is hanging for some reason, suspecting index.js in routes. used return pagination() in if statement of req.user
then used return res.render('main/home') after. Noticed that 'views' folder is misspelled as 'viewes' corrected that. Next
step is to go throughly through all folder and files to review each of them mentally noting everything out of the ordinary,
and need to test now the / route.
9. went through all files reviewed, each code line, noticed some irregularities, and one mistake that I will correct now in
passport.js line 49 when calling callback there is a typo 'verifiedCallback' instead of 'verifyCallback'. app.js line 55,56
in app.use(session) object settings resave, and saveUni
